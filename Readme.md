# Docker
This repository contains the **Docker Cheat Sheet**. I have created this cheat sheet from [Learn Docker](https://learndocker.online/) that contains 293 videos and 312 quiz questions on docker.  

**Note:** This is still evolving. I will update this as I progress through this videos.  

## Why learn Docker?
You want to work on making your app awesome, not messing with infrastructure… but every time someone joins your team, you need to spend 2 days installing stuff, no one has the same versions, and you get a call at 10pm and have to spend the next 17 hours debugging your server because someone ‘upgraded’ a dependency.

Docker can make that go away.

Add to that easy deploys, easy scaling, load balancing, app inter-op, and all the little features you'll need for your growing company, and you have a winner.

Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud. Docker’s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

Simplified in three steps:
Build -> Share -> Run
